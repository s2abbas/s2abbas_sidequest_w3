## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple interactive story built using a state-based, multi-screen game structure. The experience includes a start screen, an instructions screen with a back button, a game screen where the player makes a choice, and outcome screens that display either a win or a loss. Each screen is separated into its own file to keep the code organized and easy to understand. The focus is on showing how to separate screens into different files, route input based on the current game state, and design simple UI elements such as buttons and keyboard controls.

- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance
- Implement clickable and keyboard-accessible UI buttons
- Learn how to route draw(), mousePressed(), and keyPressed() logic based on the active screen
- Build a basic instructions screen with a functional back button

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments. I then changed some of the code using GennAI and added it in Appendix.
